            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>And truly the Princes of <hi>Orange</hi> Father and Son did make

deſtroyed the Father, expelled <pb n="16" facs="tcp:64991:12"/>the Sons, and endeavoured
to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpate the whole royal Family.</p>
            <p>When his Majeſty was by tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults driven from <hi>London,</hi> he
left his children behind him, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſent for the Prince and Duke of

from place to place, till at laſt they brought him to

               <note place="margin">At Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton-Court</note> from whence
he was by perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <pb n="20" facs="tcp:64991:14"/>deluded into the <hi>Iſle of
Wight,</hi> where he was immediately ſecured and kept a ſtrait priſoner
in <hi>Caris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brook</hi> Caſtle.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>York</hi> ſeeing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires to be managed in ſo

ſafety,<note place="margin">Du. Yorks eſcape from St. James's.</note> to
which end, finding ſome honeſt and private correſpondents in whom he
might put truſt, he propoſes his eſcape, whereunto by a mutual conſent

brought effectually and with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creſie to paſſe in <hi>Aprill</hi>
1648. ſo that on the 20th of that moneth he left St. <hi>James</hi>'s, and
was not miſſed for ſeveral houres after his his departure; by which
meanes he clearly got away with ſafety, and retired into <hi>France,</hi>
leaving his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and pretended keepers to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment their own misfortune,
while <pb n="21" facs="tcp:64991:14"/>himſelf rejoyced in his own ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and having
ſtollen himſelf from them.</p>
            <p>This loſſe added new affliction to the Duke of
<hi>Glouceſter,</hi> not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving loſt only a brother, but a comforter and
inſtructer, ſo that he began to grow melancholy, eſpecially receiving
daily intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from that mirror of her age his dear ſiſter the Lady
<hi>Elizabeth,</hi> of the hourely danger both them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and father ſtood
in; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it began to appear more and more every day, for the Army un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>Cromwell</hi> had violated the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the <hi>Iſle of Wight,</hi> and
once more laid traiterous hands on the ſacred perſon of over clouded
Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, carrying him firſt to <hi>Hurſt,</hi> and at length brought him
to St. <hi>James</hi>'s near <hi>London,</hi> where they moſt barbarouſly
murdered him.</p>
            <p>On the 29th of <hi>January,</hi> which was the day before he dyed,
he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired <pb n="22" facs="tcp:64991:15"/>he might ſee and take his laſt farewell
of his children,<note place="margin">D. Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter comes to the King, and his
anſwer to him.</note> which with ſome regret was granted, and the Lady
<hi>Elizabeth</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> brought to him. The
King taking the Duke upon his knee, ſaid, Sweet heart, now they will cut off
thy fathers head, mark child what I ſay, they will cut off my head, and
perhaps make thee a King, but you muſt not be a King ſo long as your
brothers <hi>Charles</hi> and <hi>James</hi> be living, for they will cut off
your brothers heads (when they can catch them) and cut off thy head too at the
laſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I charge you not to be made a King by them. At which
words the child ſmiling ſaid, I will be torn in pieces firſt, which
falling ſo unexpectedly from one ſo young, made the King rejoyce
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly.</p>
            <p>The ſame day the King urged it again to the little Duke, that he
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:64991:15"/>might not take the Kingdome if he regarded the good of his
ſoul, and therefore commanded him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his bleſſing not to accept
there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, unleſſe it lawfully redounded to him: to whom he anſwered to
this effect, that he hoped God would give him grace to be more contented with
the legal title of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> then the uſurped autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of that
right which from God and nature belonged to another; and after that day he
never ſaw his fathers face more.</p>
            <p>Near upon two yeares after this he continued at <hi>London,</hi>
although the Juncto had now ordered they ſhould have no longer any honour

ſomewhat cloſe to them, eſpecially when on the 31 of <hi>July</hi> 1650.
they were neceſſitated to go thither with untoward atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, and

his ſolitary meditations, when thoſe monſters at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>

un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannerly debates, they reſolve to ſhip him away beyond Sea, which 
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:64991:16"/>coming to the Dukes hearing, (being now about eleven yeares
of age) he gave God thanks that he ſhould be ſo delivered, and that he had
ſo reſtrained their malice, that though they had the will, they had not yet
the power to hurt him. My father told me (ſaid he to one about him) that God
would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for me, which he hath abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly done, in that he deliveteth me
as a Lamb out of the pawes of the devouring Lyon.</p>
            <p>According to the ſaid foreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken reſolution, they order his
go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beyond Sea, and ſend a Tutor along with him, giving him in charge,
Firſt, that he ſhould go and ſtudy at a Proteſtant School. Secondly,
that he keep correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with the Parliament by let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and that his

or brothers, or have any thing to do with them, but in all things utterly
diſown them: and fourthly, that he ſhall immediately return upon notice
from the Parliament to him given to that purpoſe; and upon theſe and the

could not be pulled up by any ſtrength, nor by any meanes be removed: of
ſuch force is educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the ſweet ſavour of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue firſt

            <p>The antient <hi>Romans,</hi> when their voices were demanded at

were for the moſt part copart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, <pb n="34" facs="tcp:64991:21"/>and inſinuating
that he that wanted learning could never merit honour.</p>
            <p>This made <hi>Licinius</hi> that was Collegue in the Empire with
<hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi> the great, be recorded by all writers with Infamy, for
that, (being uncapable of learning himſelf, by reaſon of the ſlowneſs
and barrenneſſe of his underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) was wont to call learning the very
poyſon, and publick plague that infected Realmes. The <hi>Roman</hi>
Hiſtorians wholly apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this vanity of his to want of judgement, and not
being able to comprehend the benefit of Arts.</p>
            <p>But our Royal Duke was of the Philoſopher <hi>Ariſtippus</hi>
his mind, being wont to affirm, that it was better to be a beggar then
unlearn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe the beggars penury was but want of money, but he that was
unlearned was void of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity: <pb n="35" facs="tcp:64991:21"/>and therefore (ſaith
one) if a good man,<note place="margin">Joach. Vag. in Anatol. dedic.</note> or a
learned man would ever wiſh to live long, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it would be for no other
cauſe, but that they may do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worthy of living. This made
<hi>Scaliger</hi> cry out, Nothing is better than knowledge, nothing more noble
than to reach, nothing comes ſo near to true felicity, as to learn. But we
cannot learn but from others, we cannot teach unleſſe we converſe with
others, and we can learn little or nothing truly but what we learn from others;
not by a continual poring on the book, for that (ſaith <hi>Socrates</hi>)
weakneth the memory, but by diſcourſe, and publick converſing with
men.</p>
            <p>This made the Duke of <hi>Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter,</hi> when he had thus
truly laid the foundation and ground work of his learning in his private
ſtudy at <hi>Leyden,</hi> to return again to the <pb n="36" facs="tcp:64991:22"/>Court of
<hi>France,</hi> there to ſtudy men, whereby to become more capable of
aſſiſting his brother, the moſt incomparable King of Great Britain. He
had already ſeen the beauty of many cities, known the manners of the people
of many countries, through whom he had paſſed, and learned the language of
thoſe Nations with whom he had been converſant, which ſerved him not only
for delight, but or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament: nor reſted he here, for obſerving that the
greateſt orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is the beauty of the mind, he made it his endeavour to
attain that which in moral Philoſophy is called <hi>Cultus animi,</hi>
conſonant and agreeing with thoſe of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, namely beauty, health and
ſtrength.</p>
            <p>The beauty of his mind he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in gratefull and acceptable
formes and ſweetneſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
of behaviour, which cauſed all men that had to do with <pb n="37" facs="tcp:64991:22"/>him alwayes to go from him highly ſatisfied and contented. 2. The
health of his mind con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in an immoveable conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and freedome
from paſſions, which indeed are the ſickneſſe of the mind. 3. The
ſtrength of his mind he demonſtrated in perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good and great things,
the even temper of his mind keeping him from evil and baſe things. Now the
greateſt part of men have none of theſe: ſome have one and lack the other
two, ſome few attain to have two of them, but this moſt Illuſtrious
Prince was the great Maſter of all three; which as it ſhewed a moſt deep
underſtanding, ſo the meanes whereby be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained thereunto may well
deſerve a memorial to be recommended to poſterity for great men to
imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate.</p>
            <p>The firſt thing he endeavoured was to attain experience of
formes, <pb n="38" facs="tcp:64991:23"/>which he did, by making his mind <hi>expers
rerum,</hi> for behaviour is but a garment, and it is eaſie to make a comely
garment for a body that is well proportioned; whereas a deformed body can never
be helped by Taylors art, but the counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting will appear. And in the form
of the mind it is a true rule that a man may mend his faults with as little
labour as co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them.</p>
            <p>The ſecond way he propoſed to himſelf for the aforeſaid
end, was this, to wit, imitation; and to that end he affected the worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt,
and did not think them moſt worthy whom he moſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.</p>
            <p>To obtain the health of the mind he uſed the ſame meanes which
we do for the health of our bodies, that is, to make obſervance what
diſeaſes we are apteſt to fall into, and to provide againſt them, for 
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:64991:23"/>Phyſick hath not more remedy againſt the diſeaſes
of the body, than Reaſon hath preſervatives a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the paſſions of
the mind.</p>
            <p>This made him all the while he did abide in the Court of
<hi>France,</hi> where he ſaw infinite variety and behaviour of men and
manners, that he alwayes followed and imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated the beſt, not being caught
with novelties, nor infected with Cuſtomes, not given to affectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: three
excellent vertues, that are ſeldome ſeen concurring in a perſon of his
quality.</p>
            <p>Nor did he think it enough to have been in the court, unleſſe
he viſited the camp alſo, which made him go into the Army wherein his
brother, the moſt Magnanimous Duke of <hi>York</hi> had then a command
againſt the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard;</hi> with this advantage, as alſo for many other
ſtrong mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, he laid aſide the tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe <pb n="40" facs="tcp:64991:24"/>of
his birth and breeding, and conformed his naturall cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to be fit to true
fortitude, thinking it better at the firſt to do a great deal too much, than
any thing too little; for he knew it to be an obſervation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly true,
that a young man, eſpecially a ſtrangers firſt actions, are looked upon,

an affront and indignity this was to ſuch perſons <pb n="43" facs="tcp:64991:25"/>who
had ſo highly and eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſerved at the hands of that people, I leave
to all diſcerning ſpirits to judge. The King there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore upon good advice,
having conſidered the nature of that raſh and inconſtant Nation, and
minding how once they were like to have ſerved <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh,
by delivering him into the hands of <hi>Richard</hi> the third his
meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, was not minded either to run the hazard of his own ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Perſon, or of either of his brothers, the Dukes of <hi>York</hi> and
<hi>Glouceſter,</hi> but by a timely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement to make an abſolute
prevention, and ſo not only to take away their power, but their hopes of
doing him any inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience. Hereupon they remove, not over haſtily, as in

            <p>Here the Duke of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> again retired himſelf to
a more melancholy life, by his preſent reading, fitting himſelf for fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

both his friends and confederecies, and upon what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects they leagued with

forces, being well acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <pb n="47" facs="tcp:64991:27"/>(as having been trained up
in Martial diſcipline) with many of his chief Commanders; and in cruth they
nothing failed of their expectation, although the <hi>French</hi> by the

manner, beſieging and taking <hi>Mardike, Dunkirk,</hi> and other forts from
the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> forces did as much as
could be expected from men, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in the quarter where the

<hi>Spaniard</hi> for the firſt loſſe, but continued helping them with an
undaunted courage, even till the happy reſtauration of the King of

himſelf, the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple longing with an unſatisfied ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation to ſee his
perſon, for now as he grew up apace, ſo he began to draw the eyes and
obſervation of moſt men in thoſe parts towards him, as the perſon
ordained to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce things to the antient luſtre as they were wont to be in
the dayes of the Princes of <hi>Orange</hi> his predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours. Which
others of a more facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and wicked nature murmured at, rather deſiring
that he might be layd aſide. This made his Mother to looke about her and with
care to keep correſpondencies eſpecially with thoſe Provinces that
refuſed a confaederacy with the Engliſh, like a good Prince minding
<hi>Patriae benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium</hi> the advantage of the Country more then her own
private ends: and that the world might take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice thereof, ſhe bore her Son
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany to <hi>Leyden</hi> when he went thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be inſtructed in the
Langu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages <pb n="66" facs="tcp:64991:32"/>and Sciences, and were by the Magiſtraces of
that City honourably received.</p>
            <p>The Princeſs Royal being returned to the <hi>Hague</hi> and
intending to go thence to <hi>Bredah,</hi> her Son the Prince came thither for
a few dayes from <hi>Leyden</hi> to take his leave of her, and as ſoon as
ſhe was gon he returned back again to his ſtudyes.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> all this while remained private,
only ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times viſiting in publick his Illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous brothers, being
grown famous by his retirement; and his Councils looked on as Oracles, his
knowledge being weighed not by the length of his life, but the obſervations
he made upon all occurrents, proving thereby that he that liveth long and
ſeeth much but obſerveth nothing, ſhall never prove any wiſe man.</p>
            <p>There was not any the meaneſt action whereof he took not notice,
weighing the coherence of cauſes, effects counſels and ſucceſſes,
with <pb n="71" facs="tcp:64991:32"/>the proportion and likewiſe between nature and
nature, fortune and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, action and action, ſtate and ſtate, time
paſt, and time preſent, thereby being able to render an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count both of
the manners and cuſtomes both of the places and people wherein he had
reſided.</p>
            <p>The Princeſs of <hi>Orange</hi> was now at <hi>Bredah,</hi>
where ſhe was carreſſed and courted by many forraign Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and States,
onely the King of <hi>France,</hi> by what or whoſe inſtigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not
certainly known, began to play foul, for while the old Princeſs
<hi>Dowager</hi> of <hi>Orange</hi> and ſhe, were with ſome heat
conteſting about the Guardianſhip of the Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of <hi>Orange,</hi>
the French King ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes the ſame, takes into his own
poſſeſſion the Ammunition and Arms with all other ſtrengths there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and gives out that he will keep them all for the young Princes uſe during his
minority, and as a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Steward deliver them all up <pb n="54" facs="tcp:64991:33"/>again when he comes to full age. A fair pretence, but much to be
feared that it will with great difficulty be performed, it being too generally
found true that Great men many times do wrong, becauſe they have a power in
their hands, and ſo long as that power laſts they will and do maintain the
ſame by doing greater. But although the Princeſs and all her friends did
much both doubt and fear ſuch an event from ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handſome a beginning,
yet they for the preſent ſmothered the ſame within their Breaſts,
doubting leaſt by ſhewing their fear, they ſhould cauſe a diſtruſt,

            <p>The face of affaires both in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and other parts

ſo the paſſions draw the ſoule to the fruition of her vertuous objects
and indeed the paſſions of our minds; are not unlike the humours of our
bodyes,<note place="margin">Cicero. 4. Tuſc.</note> whereunto <hi>Cicero</hi>
well com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth them, for if blood, flegm, chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler or melancholly exceed the
due proportion required to the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and health of our bodies,
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently we fall into ſome diſeaſe; ſo if the paſſions of the

that vertue requireth, <pb n="80" facs="tcp:64991:46"/>immediately the ſoul is moleſted

the preſervation of health: hereby may be gathered that paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are not
wholly to be extinguiſhed (as the <hi>Stoickes</hi> ſeem to affirme) but
rather to be ſometimes moved and ſtirred up for the ſervice of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue as
<hi>Plutarch</hi> learnedly teacheth. This hath many excellent Captaines in

                  <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> the Great (as <hi>Curtius</hi> relates
it) had experience hereof, who after he had wonne the City of <hi>Tarſon</hi>
belonging to <hi>Darius,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring upon a hot Summers day into the River
<hi>Cidmus,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by catching ſo vehement an ague that hindered his
journey at preſent againſt his Enemies, which then began to draw near to
him, he reſolved in himſelf for avoiding the threatned miſchief to take
ſome very ſtrong Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, that ſhould preſently either 
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:64991:47"/>mend or end him; To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, <hi>Philip</hi> an
ancient Phyſitian who had conſtantly waited on him from his youth was
ſpoken with, who promiſed to prepare him a Potion according to his
deſire: While <hi>Philip</hi> was making ready the Potion, <hi>Parmenio</hi>
a Captain, whom <hi>Alexander</hi> of all other moſt loved and truſted,
underſtanding the King's Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, ſent him a Letter, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſing not
to meddle with <hi>Philip</hi>'s potion, becauſe he underſtood he was
corrupted by <hi>Darius</hi> with promiſe of a thouſand Talents and his
Siſter in Marriage that he ſhould kill him; <hi>Alexander</hi> was much
perplexed in his mind at this news &amp; while he was deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with himſelf
what to doe, his Phyſitian brought him the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: when the King ſaw him
he raiſed himſelfe upon his elbow, and taking the Letter in the left Hand,
with his Right tooke the <pb n="85" facs="tcp:64991:47"/>Cup and drank off the Phyſicke;
which done, he delivered the Letter to <hi>Philip</hi> to read, and looked
earneſtly into his Face as long as he was reading, ſuppoſing that if he
had been faulty, ſome token would have appeared in his Countenance, imagining
with himſelfe that as the pulſe decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the operations of the heart,
ſo the internal cogitations and affections of the mind whether virtuous or
vicious, no where ſooner bewray themſelves, then through thoſe living
windowes wherewith Nature hath compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the oloſets of our fancy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
when <hi>Philip</hi> had read the Letter, he ſhewed more tokens of
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure then fear, which toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the proteſtations of the
Phyſitian of his innocence, aſſured <hi>Alexander</hi> ſo of his
fidelity he not onely rejected all feare of death but conceived an
extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary hope of amendment, as <pb n="86" facs="tcp:64991:48"/>indeed not long after
it proved.</p>
               <p>If it be ſo then, that the face may be called <hi>mentis
ſpeculum</hi> the minds looking-glaſſe, which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covereth the heart to
be the ſeat of our paſſions; then hence may be deduced a moſt certain
Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, that according to the diſpoſition of the heart, humors and
body, divers ſorts of perſons be ſubject to divers ſorts of
paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and the ſame paſſion affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth divers ſorts of
perſons in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers manners; for as we ſee fire applyed to dry Wood or Iron,
or Flax, or Gun-powder worketh divers wayes; for in wood it kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleth with
ſome difficulty, and with ſome difficulties is quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but in flax is
ſoon kindled and quenched, in iron very hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but in Gun-powder in a
mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and can never be quenched till the powder be Conſumed: ſo ſome
men you ſhall ſee ſoon angry and ſoon pleaſed, others 
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:64991:48"/>hardly offended and with as great difficulty reconciled,
o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are all fire, and in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with every trifle will be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed, and
till their hearts be conſumed almoſt with Choller will never ceaſe until
they be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged; which confirmes that old ſaying to be true, <hi>Animi
mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res corporis temperatum ſequuntur.</hi> As then in Maladies of the body
every man feeleth beſt his own griefe, even ſo in diſeaſes of the
ſoule every man knoweth beſt his own inclination; Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe (as
Phyſitians commonly affirm) there be certain General cauſes which incline
our bodyes to ſeveral infirmities, ſo there are likewiſe that move our
ſoules to ſundry paſſions; for it cannot be denyed or doubted but that
there are ſome affections in the higheſt and chiefeſt part of the ſoul:
for to God the Scriptures aſcribe, <hi>Love, Hatred, Anger,</hi> &amp;c. 
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:64991:49"/>although he cannot be ſubject to any ſenſitive
operation.</p>
               <p>But to return, the young Duke by a deep judgement having
wiſely foreſeen this, did for the better ordering of himſelf make uſe

               <p>To be ſhort, his wiſdome was great in that he was able to
ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe, and greater in that he was willing to be adviſed; never ſo
wedded to his own reſolves but on good ground he would be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorced from

               <p>I ſhall only give you a few of his obſervations, which while
he <pb n="91" facs="tcp:64991:50"/>lived he was known to have made, whereby his wiſdome
may be the better diſcerned; for if <hi>ex pede Herculem,</hi> as by the
bigneſs of <hi>Hercules</hi> foot, we may gueſſe at the vaſt
dimenſions of the other parts of his body, ſo the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of mens
abilities are to be learned by their ſayings; as a touch whereof I ſhall in
the way of a Corollory add only theſe few of this moſt pious Prince as
here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after they ſufficiently follow.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It was an obſervation noted by him, That Good &amp;
Great men may ſecure themſelves from guilt but not from Envy; for the
grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt in truſt of publick Affairs are ſtill ſhot at by the
aſpiring of thoſe that think themſelves leſſe in imployment then they
are in merit.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That oftentimes it is ſeen, that mens Conſciences
convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing them of another mans deſert and merit, they ſuſpect
oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <pb n="92" facs="tcp:64991:51"/>in them, whereby their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe may be
Eclipſed, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſtrive by all means to put diſgrace on his
perſon and parts, thereby to hinder his riſing; for whilſt a man is out
of imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and finding that he cannot ſo publickly expreſſe his
worth, they ſtill labour to keep him in obſcurity to the end that
them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves may appear more glorious.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It was the practiſe of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi> the
Emperor when his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy <hi>Licimus</hi> began his Warrs with
<hi>Exorciſmes</hi> and <hi>Charmes,</hi> he undertook all with prayer and
holy Meditations, and therefore the Lord of Heaven made him Lord of the Field:
and he found ſuch comfort by prayer that he ſtamped upon his coin the image
of himſelfe praying to God. The Duke inferred from thence this Concluſion,
How neceſſary this duty of prayer is for ſetling our affairs; my ſoul I
am ſure is expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimentally <pb n="93" facs="tcp:64991:51"/>ſenſible, if we ſettle
our Affairs right with God, he will ſettle our buſineſs with man: is it
not his own promiſe, <hi>Ask and it ſhall be given to you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. This alſo was a ſimilitude uſed by him. As a pot
full of Water in the heat of Summer is troubled and polluted with many flies,
but if it be boyled upon the fire they neither would nor durſt come neer it;
ſo (ſaith he) while our ſoules in prayer are cold and liveleſſe, we
are ſtill perplexed and have no reliefe from our troubles, whereas if our
minds were inflamed with zeal, all Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities would be abandoned, and our
prayers ſo rectifyed that we ſhould not offer the Sacrifice of Fools.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That there is no better mark of a true generous
ſpirit then to attempt things which are hard to be atchieved: 'Tis in vulgar
and adulterate ſpirits, that the ſoul of <pb n="94" facs="tcp:64991:52"/>motion is
wholy derived from the livelyhood of action: Noble ſpirits court dangers.
<hi>Avida eſt periculi virtus: Nec juvat ex facili lecta Corona
jugo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. He tooke great delight in that ſaying of
<hi>Ariſtippus</hi> the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher, who was wont to affirm that it was
better to be a Beggar then unlearned, becauſe the Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars penury was onely
want of Money, but he that was unlearn'd was deſtitute of humanity.</p>
               <p n="7">7. He was wont to Note that the Ladder of <hi>Jacob</hi>
mentioned in <hi>Geneſis</hi> is but a Figure of Chriſt, which by his
humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture touched Earth, and by his Divinity Heaven; therefore if we or
our prayers paſſe by this Ladder, we have the Father at the top of the
Ladder ready to receive us and our prayers.</p>
               <p n="8">8. He uſed to ſay, That it is familiar with fortune to
do more harm in one day, then ſhe doth <pb n="95" facs="tcp:64991:52"/>good in many
years, uſing in delight to raiſe up vain Men for her glory, and on a
ſudden ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them to fall with the weight of their proper vanity and
want of Government.</p>
               <p n="9">9. When he had read the Story of <hi>Archelaus</hi> King
of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> who being requeſted by a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of his Court to give
him a certain cup of Gold, delivered it to his Page, commanding him to beare
and give it to one <hi>Euripides</hi> who was there preſent; and then ſaid
to the other, As for thee, thou art worthy to aske and to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied alſo;
but <hi>Euripides</hi> is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of gifts though he ask no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Surely
ſaid the Duke, this was an excellent reward for an inſinuating Paraſite,
and a rare pattern for other Princes, who thereby may learn, that a
deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Subject ought to be rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, though his owne modeſty withhold
him from asking.</p>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:64991:53"/>
               <p n="10">10. He alwayes argued, that Faith and Obedience are to be
perſwaded, not wrought by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion: our minds, like unto generous and
Noble horſes, being beſt ruled with an eaſie bit; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit it is
neceſſary not altogether to relye on words, for two things do Eſtabliſh
a Kingdome, <hi>viz.</hi> Force and Vertue, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them produce that
ſinew of Warre, Money, according to that ſaying of <hi>Themiſtocles</hi>
going in <hi>Embaſſy</hi> to the <hi>Iſle of Andros;</hi> for Money, he
told them that he came accompanyed with two Goddeſſes, <hi>viz.</hi>
Perſwaſion and Force.</p>
               <p n="11">11. He conſtantly affirmed; that they are much
miſtaken in their ayme who think to make a man infamous by Death: for there
is no Life ſo odious, that ending in publick with conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and modeſty
changeth not hatred into pity, pity into favor, <pb n="97" facs="tcp:64991:53"/>and leaveth
not ſome favourable opinion of innocence behind it.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Another obſervation was, That a man ſhould not
derogate from himſelf, there being two many ready enough for that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, at
leaſt to believe him as one that beſt knows what he moſt wants; and
certainly he that doth cenſure himſelfe, hath no colour for an appeal, nor
perſon to appeale to, unleſſe it be from his Words to his Deeds, which
then muſt be very remarkable. Howſoever he muſt acknowledge it to be
great folly to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed that ability in himſelfe which he deſires to be
much known, for thereby he is become a diſtroyer of his own fame.</p>
               <p n="13">13. And other times he noted, That there is nothing more
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt then to Condemne thoſe things which our ſelves do not or ſee
not, eſpecially when whole Nations agree in it: for when <pb n="98" facs="tcp:64991:54"/>only time makes them pleaſe us; it is apparent that in that they
firſt diſpleaſed us, it was not their fault, but our ignorance. And it is
to be thought that all Countries have both Manners and Habits agreeing to their
Clime, which the <hi>Genius</hi> of the Countrey will infuſe into you if you
ſtay long enough in it. <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram alienam perigrinus exigit &amp; ſunm
interdum alienum facit</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="14">14. He ſaid, That the trueſt and ſecureſt
precepts of policy are thoſe which either are drawn from the prudent
reſolutions or unadviſed errors of great Princes in the deliberations of
their moſt important Affairs, or from the ſtudy of policy: all
conſiſting in a ſevere and judicious cenſure of the Actions of the
Great: and the ſtudious in Hiſtories, which have the gift to know how to
examine them, will draw out of them excellent Rules for the <pb n="99" facs="tcp:64991:54"/>well governing of many peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
               <p n="15">15. He averred it to be an Obſervation as well knowne
as true, That in the Infancy of the Church, men thought nothing too dear for
God or too good to be imparted unto the Church; but now (ſaid he) we are
arrived to ſuch times wherein all are generally Church-robbers: but the
Sacrilegious perſon and the Simoniſt never yet did nor ever ſhall
proſper to the third Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: they are the two profa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of holy things:
But God hath and will confound them in <hi>Jacob</hi> and ſcatter them in
<hi>Iſraell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus have I given you a ſhort view of the life of this moſt
Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Prince, together with a ſhort character both of his perſon and
vertues: and a demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive appearance of a moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent wiſdome, all
which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding <pb n="100" facs="tcp:64991:55"/>we muſt conclude all we can
ſay, is too ſhort; So that we muſt ſay of him as <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rharius</hi>
did when painting the <hi>Hoplitides,</hi> he could neither make him that ran
to ſweat, nor the other that put off his Armour to breath, added, <hi>No
further then co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours;</hi> ſo when we ſearched the depth of Invenction and
ſtrained Rhetorick to her higheſt pitch of Eloquence to adapt words to
ſet forth his Eulogies, we muſt at laſt ſubmit and confeſſe they
all fall ſhort of the reality that was in him; and with <hi>Alexander</hi> at
the Tomb of <hi>Achilles,</hi> burſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to tears and cry: <hi>Haeccine
Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaea ſunt?</hi> Are there all the Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies, the world could erect to
the memory of thy virtues? mean thus, it is confeſſed, yet ſuch as
ſhall eternize his Fame as long as there ſhall be a Tongue to ſpeak or an
Ear to hear</p>
               <p>I muſt not in this place forget <pb n="101" facs="tcp:64991:55"/>the late
deceaſed Princeſſe of <hi>Orange,</hi> whoſe Character I promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
you, and here ſnall briefly inſert it.</p>
               <p>Her Birth, Breeding, Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Marriage, you have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
at large related; Her perſon was of a curious make, her Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage faire,
whereto was added a graceful baſhfulneſſe which gave a luſtre to her
beauty; her eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part being decked with ſome particular Ornament; her mind
richly Embellifyed with the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt qualities, and full of wit; her ſpeech
pretious becauſe not fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent: her modeſty without parallel, and her
behaviour ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, without either pride or affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation; in ſhort, ſhe
was ſuch as we may rather admire, then prayſe according to deſert, and
whoſe loſſe we may rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayle and lament then recover.</p>
               <p>She was ſo well ſetled in the Principles of Religion, that
ſhe <pb n="102" facs="tcp:64991:56"/>remained as a Rock immoveable, and as eminent for
her courage therein, as thoſe who in former Ages did offer themſelves to
moſt grievous torments, and to death it ſelf for the love of the Truth;
immitating therein her late Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Father of Glorious and ever Bleſſed
Memory, who parted with his Life rather then he would his Religion. And indeed
ſeldome ſhall we ſee ſuch a Father without ſuch Children, or ſuch
Children without ſuch a Father; for the plant is known by the fruit, and as
is the Egge, ſo is the Bird that hatcht it. And as it is thus in vertue, ſo
likewiſe it is in vitious off-ſprings, by which means in pollicy, we may
learne by the villanous and bloody car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of ſuch mens actions how to
manage a juſt and lawful cauſe to bring Execution upon Rebels and Traytors,
that is, to do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the halfes, but when the <pb n="103" facs="tcp:64991:56"/>Sword
of Juſtice is drawn, to throw the Scabbard into the fire, <hi>Tolle

               </p>
               <p>Her devotions were Frequent and Exemplary, not ſo much out of
cuſtome performed as zeale, and that not with a cold careleſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe but
reverentiall Humility, approaching to her God as a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull Child to a tender
Father, whoſe bowels yern to give a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table anſwer to the humble
ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe of his bowing ſupplyant; being not only to her ſelfe, an
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citer, but to all about her a pious example.</p>
               <p>In the choice of her friends ſhe was very curious, chooſing
the beſt and moſt Vertuous, though not Allyed to her, with them
converſing and exerciſing vertue, <pb n="104" facs="tcp:64991:57"/>as the Philoſopher
ſpeaks:

                     </gap>.</q> And to the adviſe of ſuch
ſhe yielded conſent, as being in her ſelfe ſenſible of thoſe things
that did concerne her honour or any way conduce to her advantage.</p>
               <p>It is but a part of duty, in caſe one know better then another
to impart it for the common good; and for others mildly to obey ſuch things
as ſhall be wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repreſented.</p>
               <p>Her patience was Admirable, bearing the many croſſes of her
Life, as the Murder of her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and Exile of her Mother, and all her
neereſt Relations; with a true Chriſtian and more then Womanly Courage.</p>
               <p>Theſe indeed and the like, ſaith a Wiſe Man, are very
harſh and inſupportable to life,<note place="margin">Hierocl.</note> but yet
not really evil. So long as they occaſion us not to layſe into
wickedneſſe: for if we can bear <pb n="105" facs="tcp:64991:57"/>our Misfortunes
moderately and with reſolution, as reflecting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Cauſes and
Occaſions of them, remedying as much as in us lyes, thoſe accidents ſeeme
hurtfull, but making profitable uſe of them, but eſpecially to aim by a
perfection of vertue to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come worthy to participate of the Divine
Happineſs; <hi>In ſhort,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Such and ſo Eminent were her many Vertues that we my juſtly

Deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and Beauty is Vaine, but a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that Feareth the Lord, ſhe
ſhall be prayſed. And many Daughters have done Vertuouſly, but thou
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celleſt them all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In a word, to ſumme up all. As in things we have ſo in
thoſe we do, each hath his proper tryal to prove the Excellency thereof in
his kind; Gold by the Teſt, The Diamond by his hardneſſe, Pearle by his
water; ſo the beſt <pb n="106" facs="tcp:64991:58"/>diſcoverers of the Minds of men
are their Actions; which in the Lives and Characters of theſe two Famous Dead
Princes hath been endeavoured, with as much Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor as can on any hands be
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, It ſhall be my prayer to God to ſend Health and
Peace into the Habitations of our Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Soveraigne, and that Heaven will be
